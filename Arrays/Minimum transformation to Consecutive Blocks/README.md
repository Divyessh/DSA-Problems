## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed sequence of blocks (length n), where blocks[i] is either '0' or '1', representing the color of the ith block.

You are also given an integer k, which is the desired number of consecutive '1' blocks.

In one operation, you can transform a '0' block such that it becomes a '1' block.

Return the minimum number of transformations needed such that there is at least one occurrence of k consecutive '1' blocks.

## Code
```java
public int minTransforms(String blocks, int k){

}
```
