## Problem statement
A sudoku application generates a sudoku puzzle for user to solve. Once the user puts in the numbers and submits their solution. An algorithm runs to validate if the solution is correct or not.

Rules : 
- Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
- Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
- Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

Define the validation algorithm given a 2d matrix depicting the sudoku

Additionally, the application provides a feature where anytime the user can ask for a help to verify if the numbers entered so far have violated any of the sudoku rules or not.
