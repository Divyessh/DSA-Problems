# DSA-Problems

Hi, all I am looking forward to create a repo with solutions to various DSA problems.
The structure of repo would be
- Topic (Arrays, Tree, DP ... etc)
  - Individual problem
    - Code file(s) (prefered languages c++, java, python) Named as `Solution.cpp` / `Solution.java` / `Solution.py`
    - Readme.md (Describing the solution)
    
Will upload question to seek solutions for. Looking forward for participation from you all.
